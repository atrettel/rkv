rkv: command-line reference manager
===================================

Planned features
----------------

- Command-line interface (CLI), similar to Git or Taskwarrior.

- SQLite backend.

- Emphasis on LaTeX compatibility.  It should be possible to run the command
  from a Makefile to generate a LaTeX bibliography file.

- Support for multiple languages.  Some fields should have different values
  depending on the selected language (titles and abstracts especially).

- Support for series and periodicals as additional document types.  Entries for
  articles should reference their journal rather than specifying the
  information about the journal themselves.

- Support for report series.  It should treat technical reports as items in a
  series.  Include accession numbers and report codes organically in the
  database.
